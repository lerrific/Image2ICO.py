* ### how2use?!?!?
* `pip install pillow`
* download the file in this repository and create a shortcut of it
* windows key + r, enter `shell:sendto`
* place the shortcut in the sendto folder
* right click a png or jpg file and navigate to the send to tab, and run the script
* in the same folder your input image is, there is now an icon version of it

### why
do you ever just create your 84th console application in visual studio and want a cool icon for it but uploading an image to a converter website is such a drag because it requires clicking more than five buttons? same
